## Context

This project was carried out as part of our Python and Data Science coursework. It aims to put into practice key concepts such as **data preprocessing**, **data visualization**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**.

## Project Description

To meet our objective, we selected a dataset from Kaggle related to **bank loan approvals**. The goal was to build models capable of predicting whether a loan would be approved based on applicant data.

This required a deep understanding of the dataset, careful cleaning and preparation of the data, and the design of predictive models using both traditional **machine learning algorithms** and **neural networks**. The project allowed us to apply the full data science pipeline, from raw data to model evaluation, while comparing different approaches to determine the most effective one.
